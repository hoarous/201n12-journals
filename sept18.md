I'm not sure I agree with the premise of this journal--either that only *adults* need to know the why when they're learning, or that adults *need* to know. Learning is something that happens constantly, whether we will it or not; we learn, in Bayesian fashion--from our environments, from our own actions, and from the statistical relationships between one and the other--at all times throughout our lives. Such basic building blocks of infant cognition as object permanence and phonemic perceptual magnets are acquired in this manner, but the only reason children seem more malleable is because they have a more limited corpus of prior probabilities to check against.

It's been theorized that the subjective feeling of enjoyment is a modulator for directed learning behavior--that animals including humans engage in play behavior in order to hone particular skills on an unconscious level. This theory is borne out by comparing archetypical play behavior of many animals with their ecological niche--for example, anyone who has a cat can tell you that its play behavior mimics the motions of hunting. On a more basic level, reward-orienting behavior entails learning the statistical shape of the environment which produces the reward; enjoyment creates an endogenous reward, thus obviating the need for a physical payout for behaviors whose learning curves produce fruit only distally. Thus: play behavior.

Perhaps, then, the distinction should be between deliberate learning and passive learning--that when you set out to learn something, you should know why. Or to put it another way: in goal-oriented learning as opposed to reward-oriented, having defined "enjoyment" as a category of reward. Yet this too sits poorly with me. Goal-orientation is a strength of human behavior, but too much introspection to this end engenders the sort of anxiety that can throttle productive learning. I mentioned in an earlier journal the explore vs exploit dichotomy--too much goal-orientation in early stages of learning can be detrimental because it encourages exploit over explore. This is a mathematical reality of learning behavior, borne out both in behavioral studies and in machine learning experiments. Right now, we are definitely still in the early stages of learning in code 201--regardless of this being an adult class, we have still barely scratched the surface of the topic. We need to be able to mess around and screw up and generally explore the problem space. Knowing why we need a particular method before we learn it, for example, unnecessarily shoehorns it into a niche. Instead of asking, "why?" I think we should be asking, "what if?" Even if that line of questioning doesn't take us anywhere productive, it will add to our understanding of the topic and attendant problem space.

To answer the actual question, though, I'm here because I enjoy coding and I would like to see if I can make a career out of it. Beyond that, I'm not going to stress the "why" too hard.
