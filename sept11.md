I think something that it took me a long time to learn, especially as an adult, is when and how to ask for help. As a child, it's the teacher's look-out to keep a keen eye out for which students are struggling, and to get those kids up to speed once identified. As an adult, not only are we better at hiding it when we're having trouble, thanks to a lifetime of learning and internalizing the rules of polite society; we are also actually expected to take greater responsibility over our own learning. The fifteen minute rule mentioned in the first class is a good call for this, I think; I think it's easy to convince yourself that just a little bit more going in circles will lead you to a fruitful path, even when that's not the case. Perhaps especially if that's not the case. I'm not yet sure about what I want to learn or how I'm going to be evaluating my progress against that; for now, I'll be relying on proximal course-correction to ensure that I'm on a productive path.
