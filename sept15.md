My motivation for learning is to break into a career where my work is challenging and creatively satisfying to me. Right now I'm not having a lot of trouble with the actual content of coding at our current level in this class, but the associated executive skills--keeping track of deadlines and organization, collaborating with peers, communication--are more challenging to me. Since these are the skills that set a professional apart from a hobbyist, these are the skills I will have to focus on improving in this class.
