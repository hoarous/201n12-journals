My degree is in cognitive science, which I like to explain as being a cross between computer science and cognitive psychology, although that doesn't entirely capture the essense of the field. Computers and brains are linked in that both are thinking machines: one of my professors liked to say that we didn't understand the heart until the invention of the pump, and that we are only now beginning to understand the brain now that we've invented the computer. I worked as a research assistant in a memory and learning lab for most of my undergraduate years, so I have a deep appreciation of how the brain--or any cognitive agent, really--acquires and integrates new information. The principle that stuck with me, from both AI and human subjects results, is that *the ability to take risks is the precursor to learning*. Reinforcement learning identifies this as _explore_ vs _exploit_: do you exploit what you already know, in the interest of maximizing your rewards; or do you strike out into the unknown to explore, risking lower material reward? Of course, it is possible to risk too much; to bite off more than you can chew, and then end up with nothing. However, as an adult in continuing education, my tuition is already paid, and I have already committed to investing my time in this class. It's in my best interest to challenge myself; I would risk more by being too timid to try.
